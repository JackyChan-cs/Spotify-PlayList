# Spotify-PlayList
A compilation of csv files into one big playlist.
I compliled an entire fiscal quarters worth of csv files into one array. Then I ran a bufferedReader through the array inorder to read in the necessary information. The data is extracted into a separated arraylist where I then sorted it in alphabetical order. Afterwards I inserted it all back into a queue where I implimented a dequeue method and a last listened method.
